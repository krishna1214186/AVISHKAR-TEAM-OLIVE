# THE-BARTER-SHOP by - Team Olive
An app for exchange and donation of goods.
Finalist in Avishkar-2021.

## Problem
"A major problem nowadays is the growing pile ofwaste items that people throw because of their
change of needs."

## Our approach
Our solution to this problem is-
-One man's trash is another man's treasure.
-If two people can exchange their nonessentials with each
-It is better to donate than to throw; a large number of
other, they not only save money but also prevent waste
generation.
-People can easily donate to NGO's, if provided right
platform.
Hense this platform allows us to exchange our goods or donate them without throwing them to waste.
